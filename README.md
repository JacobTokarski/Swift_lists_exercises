# 📱 Swift Exercises Collection

• Author: Jakub Tokarski, Index: 51700 

• Completion Date: June 2025  


## 📄 Project Description

This repository contains a curated set of Swift exercises and demo projects designed to strengthen core iOS development skills and expand portfolio experience. It includes seven independent task sets, each organized into its own folder (List1, List2, etc.), covering a range of topics from basic UI setup to more advanced features like user location handling.

The first task introduces UIKit fundamentals, while the remaining exercises are built using SwiftUI, showcasing declarative UI design and modern development practices. Each list focuses on a specific concept or challenge, allowing for gradual progression in both technical complexity and practical understanding.

## ✨ Features

- **List 1 – UIKit Basics** – Demonstrates fundamental UI setup using UIKit by creating a button that triggers a welcome message on tap. Focuses on view hierarchy and event handling.  
- **List 2 – SwiftUI Contact Card** – Builds a simple contact card with an image, description, tappable link, phone number, and email. Covers layout composition and external action triggers.  
- **List 3 – Scrollable Views & Interaction** – Combines full-screen images, scrollable content, and a tappable list of iPhone models with visual feedback. Focuses on layout control and gesture handling.  
- **List 4 – Navigation & Media Display** – Includes PDF rendering, tab-based navigation, embedded web content, and view switching logic. Highlights multi-screen architecture and media integration.  
- **List 5 – Alert Variations** – Presents four distinct alert types triggered by buttons, including network status, confirmation dialogs, and reminders. Demonstrates conditional logic and user feedback mechanisms.  
- **List 6 – Image Carousel & Animation** – Implements a horizontal image slider with pagination indicators and an animated Apple logo that leads to a call-to-action. Covers animation timing and state management.  
- **List 7 – Location Services** – Retrieves and displays geographic coordinates and renders a map with a pin at Apple Park. Applies location APIs and map integration using SwiftUI.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Swift** – Programming language used for writing application logic and UI components  
- **SwiftUI** – Declarative framework for building modern user interfaces  
- **UIKit** – Legacy framework used in List 1 for basic UI setup  
- **Xcode** – Integrated development environment (IDE) for building and testing iOS applicationss
